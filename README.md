GETTING STARTED WITH SPRING ROO
===============================

Example CRM application to learn Spring Roo. I'm using a MySQL database that I first created and then reverse-engineered.

In the package org.obliquid.crm.runner, I've built a few standalone and simple scripts to test some features in isolation.

The file src/main/resources/db-schema.sql contains the database dump.
